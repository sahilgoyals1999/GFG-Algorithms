// This function generates 'x' with probability px/100,
// 'y' with probability py/100 and 'z' with probability pz/100:
// Assumption: px + py + pz = 100 where px, py and pz lie between 0 to 100
int random(int x, int y, int z, int px, int py, int pz) {
	// Generate a number from 1 to 100
	int r = rand(1, 100);
	// r is smaller than px with probability px/100
	if (r <= px) return x;
	// r is greater than px and smaller than or equal to px+py with probability py/100
	if (r <= (px + py)) return y;
	// r is greater than px+py and smaller than or equal to 100 with probability pz/100
	else return z;
